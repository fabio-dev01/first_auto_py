<h1>What is it?</h1>
My first Python code to automate work.

It does:

<ul>
<li>Enter the system download a report</li>
<li>summarize the data (billing and quantity of products sold)</li>
<li>send an email with this data.</li>
</ul>

<b>Anaconda 3, Windows 7</b>

- Import this code for your Notebook, with Jupyter.

Change some links and email address.
I used personal email and my Google Drive account.
NOTE: You must be logged into your system and your email account
NOTE2: This code reads an Excel file.
